If a file called <strong>filename</strong>      does not already exist, it will be created. <br />    </p>    <p>You can use google to find out how to use nano.� For example, there is an      explanation of the commands available <a href="http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/reu/nano.html"        target="_blank">here</a>.�
      We are going to use nano to make a new file called <strong>science.txt</strong>      that we will use in throughout this tutorial. To start, make sure you are      in your home directory using the command line on Linux:</p>    <p class="command"> % cd ~</p>    <p>Use nano to create a file in your home directory called <strong>science.txt</strong>    </p>    <p class="command"> % nano science.txt</p>    <p>Copy the text that is going to be used in this file from <a href="science.txt"        target="_blank">this
        link</a>, and paste it into nano. Then, use Ctrl-o to save the file      (confirm the filename when asked), and Ctrl-x to exit nano.� You should      now have a file called <strong>science.txt </strong>in your home      directory (you can confirm this using the <samp>ls</samp> command you in      part one).<br />    </p>    <h2>2.2 Copying Files</h2>    <h3>cp (copy)</h3>    <p> <samp>cp <var>file1 file2</var></samp> is the command which makes a      copy of <strong>file1</strong> in the current working directory and calls      it <strong>file2</strong> </p>    <p> What we are going to do now, is to take the file you previously created      in your home directory, and use the <samp>cp</samp> command to copy it to      your unixstuff directory. </p>    <p> First, <samp>cd</samp> to your unixstuff directory.</p>    <p class="command"> % cd ~/unixstuff</p>    <p> Then at the UNIX prompt, type, </p>    <p class="command"> % cp ~/science.txt . </p>    <p> (Note: Don't forget the dot (<samp>.</samp>) at the end. Remember, in      UNIX, the dot means the current directory.) </p>    <p> The above command means copy the file <strong>science.txt</strong> to      the current directory, keeping the name the same.� </p>    <h3>Exercise 2a</h3>    <p>Create a backup of your <strong>science.txt</strong> file by copying it      to a file called <strong>science.bak</strong> </p>    <h2>2.3 Moving files</h2>    <h3>mv (move)</h3>    <p><samp>mv <var>file1 file2</var></samp> moves (or renames) <strong>file1</strong>      to <strong>file2</strong> </p>    <p> To move a file from one place to another, use the <samp>mv</samp>      command. This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so      you end up with only one file rather than two. </p>    <p> It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same      directory, but giving it a different name. </p>    <p> We are now going to move the file science.bak to your backup directory.    </p>    <p>First, change directories to your unixstuff directory (can you remember      how?). Then, inside the <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory, type</p>    <p class="command"> % mv science.bak backups/.</p>    <p> Type <code>ls</code> and <code>ls backups</code> to see if it has      worked. </p>    <h2>2.4 Removing files and directories </h2>    <h3>rm (remove), rmdir (remove directory)</h3>    <p>To delete (remove) a file, use the <samp>rm</samp> command. As an      example, we are going to create a copy of the <strong>science.txt</strong>      file then delete it. </p>    <p> Inside your <strong>unixstuff</strong> directory, type</p>    <p class="command"> % cp science.txt tempfile.txt<br />      % ls (to check if it has created the file)<br />      % rm tempfile.txt <br />      % ls (to check if it has deleted the file) </p>    <p> You can use the <samp>rmdir</samp> command to remove a directory (make      sure it is empty first). Try to remove the <strong>backups</strong>      directory. You will not be able to since UNIX will not let you remove a      non-empty directory.</p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>Exercise 2b</h3>    <p>Create a directory called <strong>tempstuff</strong> using <samp>mkdir</samp>      , then remove it using the <samp>rmdir</samp> command.</p>    <h2>2.5 Displaying the contents of a file on the screen </h2>    <h3>clear (clear screen)</h3>    <p>Before you start the next section, you may like to clear the terminal      window of the previous commands so the output of the following commands      can be clearly understood. </p>    <p> At the prompt, type </p>    <p class="command"> % clear </p>    <p> This will clear all text and leave you with the % prompt at the top of      the window. </p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>cat (concatenate)</h3>    <p>The command <samp>cat</samp> can be used to display the contents of a      file on the screen. Type: </p>    <p class="command"> % cat science.txt </p>    <p> As you can see, the file is longer than than the size of the window, so      it scrolls past making it unreadable. </p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>less</h3>    <p>The command <samp>less</samp> writes the contents of a file onto the      screen a page at a time. Type </p>    <p class="command"> % less science.txt </p>    <p> Press the <code>[space-bar]</code> if you want to see another page,      type <code>[q]</code> if you want to quit reading. As you can see, <samp>less</samp>      is used in preference to <samp>cat</samp> for long files. </p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>head</h3>    <p>The <samp>head</samp> command writes the first ten lines of a file to      the screen. </p>    <p> First clear the screen then type </p>    <p class="command"> % head science.txt </p>    <p> Then type </p>    <p class="command"> % head -5 science.txt </p>    <p> What difference did the -5 do to the head command? </p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>tail</h3>    <p>The <samp>tail</samp> command writes the last ten lines of a file to the      screen. </p>    <p> Clear the screen and type </p>    <p class="command"> % tail science.txt </p>    <p> How can you view the last 15 lines of the file? </p>    <p>�</p>    <h2>2.6 Searching the contents of a file </h2>    <h3>Simple searching using less</h3>    <p>Using <samp>less</samp>, you can search though a text file for a keyword      (pattern). For example, to search through <strong>science.txt</strong>      for the word 'science', type </p>    <p class="command"> % less science.txt </p>    <p> then, still in <samp>less</samp> (i.e. don't press [q] to quit), type a      forward slash <code>[/]</code> followed by the word to search</p>    <p class="command"> /science</p>    <p> As you can see, <samp>less</samp> finds and highlights the keyword.      Type <code>[n]</code> to search for the next occurrence of the word. </p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>grep (don't ask why it is called grep)</h3>    <p><samp>grep</samp> is one of many standard UNIX utilities. It searches      files for specified words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type </p>    <p class="command"> % grep science science.txt </p>    <p> As you can see, <samp>grep</samp> has printed out each line containg      the word science. </p>    <p> Or has it???? </p>    <p> Try typing </p>    <p class="command"> % grep Science science.txt </p>    <p> The <samp>grep</samp> command is case sensitive; it distinguishes      between Science and science. </p>    <p> To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the -i option, i.e. type </p>    <p class="command"> % grep -i science science.txt </p>    <p> To search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes      (the apostrophe symbol). For example to search for spinning top, type </p>    <p class="command"> % grep -i 'spinning top' science.txt </p>    <p> Some of the other options of grep are: </p>    <p> -v display those lines that do NOT match <br />      -n precede each maching line with the line number <br />      -c print only the total count of matched lines <br />    </p>    <p> Try some of them and see the different results. Don't forget, you can      use more than one option at a time, for example, the number of lines      without the words science or Science is</p>    <p class="command"> % grep -ivc science science.txt </p>    <p>�</p>    <h3>wc (word count)</h3>    <p>A handy little utility is the <samp>wc</samp> command, short for word      count. To do a word count on <strong>science.txt</strong>, type </p>    <p class="command"> % wc -w science.txt </p>    <p> To find out how many lines the file has, type </p>    <p class="command"> % wc -l science.txt </p>    <h2>Summary </h2>    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1" align="center">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td><code>cp <var>file1 file2</var></code></td>          <td>copy file1 and call it file2</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>mv <var>file1 file2</var></code></td>          <td>move or rename file1 to file2</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>rm <var>file</var></code></td>          <td>remove a file</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>rmdir <var>directory</var></code></td>          <td>remove a directory</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>cat <var>file</var></code></td>          <td>display a file</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>more <var>file</var></code></td>          <td>display a file a page at a time</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>head <var>file</var></code></td>          <td>display the first few lines of a file</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>tail <var>file</var></code></td>          <td>display the last few lines of a file</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>grep <var>'keyword' file</var></code></td>          <td>search a file for keywords</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td><code>wc <var>file</var></code></td>          <td>count number of lines/words/characters in file</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <p>�</p>    <p class="navbar"><a href="unix1.html"><img width="37" height="39" border="0"          alt="Previous"          src="media/left.gif" /></a>      <a href="index.html"><img width="81" height="39" border="0" alt="Home" src="media/home.gif" /></a><a        href="unix3.html"><img          width="37"          height="39"          border="0"          alt="Next"          src="media/right.gif" /></a>    </p>    <p class="date"><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/M.Stonebank/"><font          color="#FFFFCC">original
